Decided to try to create a few public repos in GitHub. I figure it'd be nice to learn the basics of a few other languages - and some public repos would be a good way of practising. 

Going to get started with Python. I'd like a tool that is capable of summarising my situation with work annual leave. 

It'll read in from some form of file the 'input data' - which will be a summary of dates, marked as either taken or booked. I imagine there will be another file that indexes the number of days that I am entitled by year. 

When I run the script, I'd like it to use the current date, read in the input data, and tell me: 

* how many days I had
* how many I've taken
* how many I've booked
* and therefore how many I have remaining
